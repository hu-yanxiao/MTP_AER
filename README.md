# MTP_AER
This is a modified [MLIP-2](https://gitlab.com/ashapeev/mlip-2/-/tree/master?ref_type=heads) package supporting atomic energy regularazition (AER).
AER is defined as:

AER builds up the relationship between local decompostion and global atomic-environmental information,thereby effectively constraining the atomic energy distribution. By considering AER, we reformulate the model optimization of MTP as:

The ùúÜ_1 and ùúÜ_2 are non-negative weights. In program, ther are determined by following command:
```bash
mlp train untrained.mtp trainset.cfg --std-weight ùúÜ_1 --stdd-weight ùúÜ_2 ...
```
The global term of AER is determined by chemical potential of simple substance.

Œº_t is calculated by DFT and read by program from .mtp file, like this:

If item "mu_ " is missed in .mtp file, the default values are set to 0.
